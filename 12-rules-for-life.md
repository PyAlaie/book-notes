# 12 Rules For Life, An Antidote To Chaos

## Jordan B Peterson

### 1. Stand Up Straight With Your Shoulders Back

- It should be pointed out however, that sheer physical power is an unstable basis on which to found lasting dominance.

- When operating at the bottom (of dominance hierarchy), the ancient brain counter assumes that even the smallest unexpected impediment might produce an uncontrollable chain of negative events, which will have to be handled alone, as useful friends are rare indeed, on society’s fringes. You will therefore continually sacrifice what you could otherwise physically store for the future, using it up on heightened readiness and the possibility of immediate panicked action in the present. When you don’t know what to do, you must be prepared to do anything and everything, in case it becomes necessary. You’re sitting in your car with the gas and brake pedals both punched to the mat. Too much of that and everything falls apart.

- There is very little difference between the capacity for mayhem and destruction,
integrated, and strength of character. This is one of the most difficult lessons of life. (You cannot have self-respect until you grow teeth)

- Standing up straight with your shoulders back is not something that is only physical, because you’re not only a body. You’re a spirit, so to speak—a psyche—as well. Standing up physically also implies and
invokes and demands standing up metaphysically. Standing up means voluntarily accepting the burden of Being. Your nervous system responds in an entirely different manner when you face the demands of life voluntarily. You respond to a challenge, instead of bracing for a catastrophe. You see the gold the dragon hoards, instead of shrinking in terror from the all-too-real fact of the dragon. You step forward to take your place in the dominance hierarchy, and occupy your territory, manifesting your willingness to defend, expand and transform it.

- To stand up straight with your shoulders back is to accept the terrible responsibility of life,
with eyes wide open. It means deciding to voluntarily transform the chaos of potential into the
realities of habitable order. It means adopting the burden of self-conscious vulnerability, and
accepting the end of the unconscious paradise of childhood, where finitude and mortality are
only dimly comprehended. It means willingly undertaking the sacrifices necessary to generate a
productive and meaningful reality (it means acting to please God, in the ancient language).

- Dare to be dangerous.

### 2. Treat Yourself Like Someone You Are Responsible For Helping

- Why should anyone take care of anything as naked, ugly, ashamed, frightened, worthless, cowardly,
resentful, defensive and accusatory as a descendant of Adam?

- You’re bad enough, as other people know
you. But only you know the full range of your secret transgressions, insufficiencies and
inadequacies. No one is more familiar than you with all the ways your mind and body are
flawed. No one has more reason to hold you in contempt, to see you as pathetic—and by
withholding something that might do you good, you can punish yourself for all your failings.

- If we wish to take care of ourselves properly, we would have to respect ourselves—but we
don’t, because we are—not least in our own eyes—fallen creatures. If we lived in Truth; if we
spoke the Truth—then we could walk with God once again, and respect ourselves, and others,
and the world. Then we might treat ourselves like people we cared for.

- There is little difference between standing up and speaking for yourself, when you are being bullied or
otherwise tormented and enslaved, and standing up and speaking for someone else. As Jung
points out, this means embracing and loving the sinner who is yourself, as much as forgiving
and aiding someone else who is stumbling and imperfect.

### 3. Make Friends With People Who Want The Best For You

- Not everyone who is failing is a victim, and not everyone at the bottom
wishes to rise, although many do, and many manage it. Nonetheless, people will often accept or
even amplify their own suffering, as well as that of others, if they can brandish it as evidence of
the world’s injustice.

- Maybe your misery is the weapon you brandish in your hatred for those who rose upward
while you waited and sank. Maybe your misery is your attempt to prove the world’s injustice,
instead of the evidence of your own sin, your own missing of the mark, your conscious refusal
to strive and to live. Maybe your willingness to suffer in failure is inexhaustible, given what you
use that suffering to prove. Maybe it’s your revenge on Being. How exactly should I befriend
you when you’re in such a place? How exactly could I?

- If you have a friend whose friendship you wouldn’t recommend
to your sister, or your father, or your son, why would you have such a friend for yourself?

### 4. Compare Yourself To Who You Were Yesterday, Not To Who Someone Else Is Today

- What you aim at determines what you see.

- You can only find out what you actually believe (rather than what you think you believe) by watching how you act. you simply don't know what you believe, before that. You are too complex to understand yourself.

### 5. Do Not Let Your Children Do Anything That Will Make You Dislike Them

### 6. Set Your House In Perfect Order Before Criticize The World

- Whenever we experience injustice, real or imagined; whenever we encounter tragedy or fall prey to the
machinations of others; whenever we experience the horror and pain of our own apparently
arbitrary limitations—the temptation to question Being and then to curse it rises foully from the
darkness. Why must innocent people suffer so terribly? What kind of bloody, horrible planet is
this, anyway?

### 7. Pursue What Is Meaningful (Not What Is Expedient)

- Understanding is often acted out before it can be articulated (just as a child acts out what it means to be mother or father before being able to give a spoken account of what those roles mean)

- To complicate the matter, such delay (delay of gratification) only becomes useful when
civilization has stabilized itself enough to guarantee the existence of the delayed reward, in the
future. If everything you save will be destroyed or, worse, stolen, there is no point in saving. It

- We’ll start our analysis with a truism, stark, self-evident and understated: Sometimes things
do not go well. That seems to have much to do with the terrible nature of the world, with its
plagues and famines and tyrannies and betrayals. But here’s the rub: sometimes, when things are
not going well, it’s not the world that’s the cause. The cause is instead that which is currently
most valued, subjectively and personally. Why? Because the world is revealed, to an
indeterminate degree, through the template of your values. If the world you are seeing is not the world you want, therefore, it’s time to examine your values. It’s
time to rid yourself of your current presuppositions. It’s time to let go. It might even be time to
sacrifice what you love best, so that you can become who you might become, instead of staying
who you are.

- The tragedy of self-conscious Being produces suffering, inevitable suffering. That suffering in
turn motivates the desire for selfish, immediate gratification—for expediency. But sacrifice—
and work—serves far more effectively than short-term impulsive pleasure at keeping suffering
at bay. However, tragedy itself (conceived of as the arbitrary harshness of society and nature, set
against the vulnerability of the individual) is not the only—and perhaps not even the primary—
source of suffering. There is also the problem of evil to consider. The world is set hard against
us, of a certainty, but man’s inhumanity to man is something even worse. Thus, the problem of
sacrifice is compounded in its complexity: it is not only privation and mortal limitation that
must be addressed by work—by the willingness to offer, and to give up. It is the problem of evil
as well.

- Consider, once again, the story of Adam and Eve. Life becomes very hard for their children
(that’s us) after the fall and awakening of our archetypal parents. First is the terrible fate
awaiting us in the post-Paradisal world—in the world of history. Not the least of this is what
Goethe called “our creative, endless toil.” Humans work, as we have seen. We work because
we have awakened to the truth of our own vulnerability, our subjugation to disease and death,
and wish to protect ourselves for as long as possible. Once we can see the future, we must
prepare for it, or live in denial and terror. We therefore sacrifice the pleasures of today for the
sake of a better tomorrow. But the realization of mortality and the necessity of work is not the
only revelation to Adam and Eve when they eat the forbidden Fruit, wake up, and open their
eyes. They were also granted (or cursed by) the knowledge of Good and Evil.

- Once you become consciously aware that you, yourself, are vulnerable, you
understand the nature of human vulnerability, in general. You understand what it’s like to be
fearful, and angry, and resentful, and bitter. You understand what pain means. And once you
truly understand such feelings in yourself, and how they’re produced, you understand how to then in others .

- Evil enters the world with self-consciousness.

- A long period of unfreedom adherence to a singular interpretive structure os necessary for the development of a free mind.

- We cannot invent our own values, because we cannot merely impose what we believe on our souls.

- There are some actions that are so intrinsically terrible that they run counter to the proper nature of human being. There are evil actions. No excuses are available for engaging in them.

- Become aware of your own
insufficiency—your cowardice, malevolence, resentment and hatred. Consider the
murderousness of your own spirit before you dare accuse others, and before you attempt to
repair the fabric of the world. Maybe it’s not the world that’s at fault. Maybe it’s you. You’ve
failed to make the mark.

- Above all, don’t lie. Don’t lie about anything, ever. Lying leads to Hell. It was the great
and the small lies of the Nazi and Communist states that produced the deaths of millions of
people.

- Meaning signifies that you
are in the right place, at the right time, properly balanced between order and chaos, where
everything lines up as best it can at that moment.

### 8. Tell The Truth, Or At Least Don't Lie

- What should you do when you don't know what t do? Tell the truth.

- Manipulating the world (or lying) is what university students do when they write an essay to please the professor, instead of articulating and clarifying their own ideas.

- Someone living a life-lie is attempting to manipulate reality with perception, thought and
action, so that only some narrowly desired and pre-defined outcome is allowed to exist. A life
lived in this manner is based, consciously or unconsciously, on two premises. The first is that
current knowledge is sufficient to define what is good, unquestioningly, far into the future. The
second is that reality would be unbearable if left to its own devices. The first presumption is
philosophically unjustifiable. What you are currently aiming at might not be worth attaining,
just as what you are currently doing might be an error. The second is even worse. It is valid only
if reality is intrinsically intolerable and, simultaneously, something that can be successfully
manipulated and distorted. Such speaking and thinking requires the arrogance and certainty that
the English poet John Milton’s genius identified with Satan, God’s highest angel gone most
spectacularly wrong. The faculty of rationality inclines dangerously to pride: all I know is all
that needs to be known. Pride falls in love with its own creations, and tries to make them
absolute.

- If you say no to your boss, or your spouse, or your mother, when it needs to be said, then you
transform yourself into someone who can say no when it needs to be said. If you say yes when
no needs to be said, however, you transform yourself into someone who can only say yes, even
when it is very clearly time to say no. If you ever wonder how perfectly ordinary, decent people
could find themselves doing the terrible things the gulag camp guards did, you now have your
answer. By the time no seriously needed to be said, there was no one left capable of saying it.

- Error necessitates sacrifice to correct it, and serious error necessitates serious sacrifice. To accept the
truth means to sacrifice—and if you have rejected the truth for a long time, then you’ve run up a
dangerously large sacrificial debt.

- Deceitful, inauthentic individual existence is the precursor to social totalitarianism.

- It is the greatest temptation of the rational faculty to glorify its own capacity
and its own productions and to claim that in the face of its theories nothing transcendent or
outside its domain need exist. This means that all important facts have been discovered. This
means that nothing important remains unknown. But most importantly, it means denial of the
necessity for courageous individual confrontation with Being. What is going to save you? The
totalitarian says, in essence, “You must rely on faith in what you already know.” But that is not
what saves. What saves is the willingness to learn from what you don’t know. That is faith in the
possibility of human transformation. That is faith in the sacrifice of the current self for the self
that could be. The totalitarian denies the necessity for the individual to take ultimate
responsibility for Being.

- That denial is the meaning of rebellion against “the most High.” That is what totalitarian
means: Everything that needs to be discovered has been discovered. Everything will unfold
precisely as planned. All problems will vanish, forever, once the perfect system is accepted.

- It is our responsibility to see what is before our eyes, courageously, and to learn from it, even
if it seems horrible—even if the horror of seeing it damages our consciousness, and half-blinds
us. The act of seeing is particularly important when it challenges what we know and rely on,
upsetting and destabilizing us. It is the act of seeing that informs the individual and updates the
state. It was for this reason that Nietzsche said that a man’s worth was determined by how much
truth he could tolerate. You are by no means only what you already know. You are also all that
which you could know, if you only would. Thus, you should never sacrifice what you could be
for what you are. You should never give up the better that resides within for the security you
already have—and certainly not when you have already caught a glimpse, an undeniable
glimpse, of something beyond.

- Most lies are acted out rather than told.

- We transform manifold possibilities of the future into the actualities of past and present.

### 9. Assume That The Person You Are Listening To Might Know Something That You Don't

- True thinking is rare—just like true listening. Thinking is listening to yourself. It’s difficult. To
think, you have to be at least two people at the same time. Then you have to let those people
disagree. Thinking is an internal dialogue between two or more different views of the world.

- You already know what you know, after all—and, unless your life is perfect, what you know
is not enough. You remain threatened by disease, and self-deception, and unhappiness, and
malevolence, and betrayal, and corruption, and pain, and limitation. You are subject to all these
things, in the final analysis, because you are just too ignorant to protect yourself. If you just
knew enough, you could be healthier and more honest. You would suffer less. You could
recognize, resist and even triumph over malevolence and evil. You would neither betray a
friend, nor deal falsely and deceitfully in business, politics or love. However, your current
knowledge has neither made you perfect nor kept you safe. So, it is insufficient, by definition—
radically, fatally insufficient.

- You must accept this before you can converse philosophically, instead of convincing,
oppressing, dominating or even amusing. You must accept this before you can tolerate a
conversation where the Word that eternally mediates between order and chaos is operating.

### 10. Be Precise In Your Speech

- What we perceive, when things fall apart, is no longer the stage and settings of habitable
order. It’s the abyss, to
speak biblically—the chaos forever lurking beneath our thin surfaces of security. It’s from that
chaos that the Holy Word of God Himself extracted order at the beginning of time, according to
the oldest opinions expressed by mankind (and it is in the image of that same Word that we
were made, male and female, according to the same opinions). It’s from that chaos that
whatever stability we had the good fortune to experience emerged, originally—for some limited
time—when we first learned to perceive. It’s chaos that we see, when things fall apart (even
though we cannot truly see it). What does all this mean?

- There is a story for children, There’s No Such Thing as a Dragon, by Jack Kent, that I really
like. It’s a very simple tale, at least on the surface. I once read its few pages to a group of retired
University of Toronto alumni, and explained its symbolic meaning.It’s about a small boy,
Billy Bixbee, who spies a dragon sitting on his bed one morning. It’s about the size of a house
cat, and friendly. He tells his mother about it, but she tells him that there’s no such thing as a
dragon. So, it starts to grow. It eats all of Billy’s pancakes. Soon it fills the whole house. Mom
tries to vacuum, but she has to go in and out of the house through the windows because of the
dragon everywhere. It takes her forever. Then, the dragon runs off with the house. Billy’s dad
comes home—and there’s just an empty space, where he used to live. The mailman tells him
where the house went. He chases after it, climbs up the dragon’s head and neck (now sprawling
out into the street) and rejoins his wife and son. Mom still insists that the dragon does not exist,
but Billy, who’s pretty much had it by now, insists, “There is a dragon, Mom.” Instantly, it starts
to shrink. Soon, it’s cat-sized again. Everyone agrees that dragons of that size (1) exist and (2)
are much preferable to their gigantic counterparts. Mom, eyes reluctantly opened by this point,
asks somewhat plaintively why it had to get so big. Billy quietly suggests: “maybe it wanted to
be noticed.”

- To re-emerge, to escape, to be reborn, one must thoughtfully articulate the reality he or she comfortably but dangerously left hidden behind a veil of ignorance and the pretence of peace.

# Man's search for meaning

## viktor frankl

- If there is a meaning in life at all, then there must be a
meaning in suffering. Suffering is an ineradicable part
of life, even as fate and death. Without suffering and
death human life cannot be complete.

- Such people (people who lost their hold on life) forget that often it is just such an exceptionally difficult external situation which gives man the opportunity to grow spiritually beyond himself. Instead of taking the camp's difficulties as a test of their
inner strength, they did not take their life seriously and
despised it as something of no consequence. They
preferred to close their eyes and to live in the past.
Life for such people became meaningless.

- Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and
to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each
individual.

- The meaning of life, differ
from man to man, and from moment to moment. Thus
it is impossible to define the meaning of life in a general
way. Questions about the meaning of life can never be
answered by sweeping statements. "Life" does not
mean something vague, but something very real and
concrete, just as life's tasks are also very real and
concrete. They form man's destiny, which is different
and unique for each individual. No man and no destiny
can be compared with any other man or any other
destiny. No situation repeats itself, and each situation
calls for a different response.

- When a man finds that it is his destiny to suffer, he
will have to accept his suffering as his task; his single
and unique task. He will have to acknowledge the fact
that even in suffering he is unique and alone in the
universe. No one can relieve him of his suffering or
suffer in his place. His unique opportunity lies in the
way in which he bears his burden.

- The rift dividing good from evil, which goes through all
human beings, reaches into the lowest depths and becomes apparent even on the bottom of the abyss which is
laid open by the concentration camp.

- Man's search for meaning is the primary motivation
in his life and not a "secondary rationalization" of
instinctual drives. This meaning is unique and specific
in that it must and can be fulfilled by him alone; only
then does it achieve a significance which will satisfy
his own will to meaning.

- the meaning of life differs from man to man, from day to day and from hour to hour. What
matters, therefore, is not the meaning of life in general
but rather the specific meaning of a person's life at a
given moment. To put the question in general terms
would be comparable to the question posed to a chess
champion: "Tell me, Master, what is the best move in
the world?" There simply is no such thing as the best
or even a good move apart from a particular situation
in a game and the particular personality of one's
opponent. The same holds for human existence. One
should not search for an abstract meaning of life.
Everyone has his own specific vocation or mission in
life to carry out a concrete assignment which demands
fulfillment. Therein he cannot be replaced, nor can his
life be repeated. Thus, everyone's task is as unique as
is his specific opportunity to implement it.

- As each situation in life represents a challenge to
man and presents a problem for him to solve, the
question of the meaning of life may actually be reversed. Ultimately, man should not ask what the
meaning of his life is, but rather he must recognize that
it is he who is asked. In a word, each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by
answering for his own life; to life he can only respond
by being responsible.

- By declaring that man is responsible and must actualize the potential meaning of his life, I wish to stress
that the true meaning of life is to be discovered in the
world rather than within man or his own psyche, as
though it were a closed system. I have termed this
constitutive characteristic "the self-transcendence of
human existence." It denotes the fact that being human always points, and is directed, to something, or
someone, other than oneself - be it a meaning to fulfill
or another human being to encounter. The more one
forgets himself - by giving himself to a cause to serve
or another person to love - the more human he is and
the more he actualizes himself. What is called self-
actualization is not an attainable aim at all, for the
simple reason that the more one would strive for it, the
more he would miss it. In other words, self-actualization is possible only as a side-effect of self-transcendence.

- our current
mental-hygiene philosophy stresses the idea that people ought to be happy, that unhappiness is a symptom
of maladjustment. Such a value system might be responsible for the fact that the burden of unavoidable
unhappiness is increased by unhappiness about being
unhappy.

- There are situations in which one is cut off from the
opportunity to do one's work or to enjoy one's life; but
what never can be ruled out is the unavoidability of
suffering. In accepting this challenge to suffer bravely,
life has a meaning up to the last moment, and it retains
this meaning literally to the end. In other words, life's
meaning is an unconditional one, for it even includes
the potential meaning of unavoidable suffering.
